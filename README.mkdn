# SYNOPSIS

    use Data::Object::Autobox;

    my $input  = [1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,5,6,7,8,9];
    my $output = $input->grep('$a < 5')->unique->sort; # [1,2,3]

    $output->isa('Data::Object::Array');
    $output->join(',')->print; # 1,2,3

# DESCRIPTION

Data::Object::Autobox implements autoboxing via [autobox](https://metacpan.org/pod/autobox) to provide
[boxing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_type_\(object-oriented_programming\))
for native Perl 5 data types. This functionality is provided by [Data::Object](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Object)
which provides a collection of object classes for handling SCALAR, ARRAY, HASH,
CODE, INTEGER, FLOAT, NUMBER, STRING, UNDEF, and UNIVERSAL data type operations.
Data::Object provides its own boxing strategy in that every method call which
would normally return a native data type will return a data type object, but
this functionality requires an initial data type object. Data::Object::Autobox
makes it so that you do not need to explicitly create the initial data type
object, and once the initial autobox method call is made, the Data::Object
boxing takes over. **Note: This is an early release available for testing and
feedback and as such is subject to change.**

# FLAVORS

Data::Object::Autobox endeavors to implement autoboxing in various flavors to be
suitable in different environments. Currently, there are two boxing flavors
available, `autoload` and `composite`, both of which implement the boxing
architecture but handle dispatching and returning is different ways. The default
boxing flavor is `composite` because that flavor is the closest, in
implementation, to what most people are already familiar with. The following
example describes how flavors are enacted:

    use Data::Object::Autobox -autoload;  # autoboxing via autoload
    use Data::Object::Autobox -composite; # autoboxing via composite

The differences between the main boxing flavors is in how they react to input,
dispatch, and return data. The `autoload` flavor uses AUTOLOAD to delegate
autoboxing to the [Data::Object](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Object) framework. It is likely that once the initial
delegation happens, autoboxing is no longer necessary in the chaining of
routines. Additionally, the data returned from autoboxed actions under autoload
will always be Data::Object instances.

Conversely, the `composite` flavor uses role composition, with the respective
roles which [Data::Object](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Object) objects are comprised of, to provide type-specific
boxing functions only. This implementation uses the typical autoboxing approach,
i.e. the autobox pragma handles the boxing, compsition provides the functions,
and the data returned is not a Data::Object instance.

## Array Methods

Array methods are called on array references, for example, using `$array->method(@args)`, which will act on the `$array` reference and will
return a new data type object. Many array methods are simply wrappers around
core functions, but there are additional operations and modifications to core
behavior. Array methods are handled via the [Data::Object::Array](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Object::Array) object class
which is provided to the autobox ARRAY option.

## Code Methods

Code methods are called on code references, for example, using `$code->method(@args)`, which will act on the `$code` reference and will
return a new data type object. Many code methods are simply wrappers around
core functions, but there are additional operations and modifications to core
behavior. Code methods are handled via the [Data::Object::Code](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Object::Code) object class
which is provided to the autobox CODE option.

## Float Methods

Float methods are called on float values, for example, using `$float->method(@args)`, which will act on the `$float` value and will
return a new data type object. Many float methods are simply wrappers around
core functions, but there are additional operations and modifications to core
behavior. Float methods are handled via the [Data::Object::Float](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Object::Float) object class
which is provided to the autobox FLOAT option.

## Hash Methods

Hash methods are called on hash references, for example, using `$hash->method(@args)`, which will act on the `$hash` reference and will
return a new data type object. Many hash methods are simply wrappers around
core functions, but there are additional operations and modifications to core
behavior. Hash methods are handled via the [Data::Object::Hash](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Object::Hash) object class
which is provided to the autobox HASH option.

## Integer Methods

Integer methods are called on integer values, for example, using `$integer->method(@args)`, which will act on the `$integer` value and will
return a new data type object. Many integer methods are simply wrappers around
core functions, but there are additional operations and modifications to core
behavior. Integer methods are handled via the [Data::Object::Integer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Object::Integer) object
class which is provided to the autobox INTEGER option.

## Number Methods

Number methods are called on number values, for example, using `$number->method(@args)`, which will act on the `$number` value and will
return a new data type object. Many number methods are simply wrappers around
core functions, but there are additional operations and modifications to core
behavior. Number methods are handled via the [Data::Object::Number](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Object::Number) object
class which is provided to the autobox NUMBER option.

## Scalar Methods

Scalar methods are called on scalar references and values, for example, using
`$scalar->method(@args)`, which will act on the `$scalar` reference and
will return a new data type object. Many scalar methods are simply wrappers
around core functions, but there are additional operations and modifications to
core behavior. Scalar methods are handled via the [Data::Object::Scalar](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Object::Scalar) object
class which is provided to the autobox SCALAR option.

## String Methods

String methods are called on string values, for example, using `$string->method(@args)`, which will act on the `$string` value and will
return a new data type object. Many string methods are simply wrappers around
core functions, but there are additional operations and modifications to core
behavior. String methods are handled via the [Data::Object::String](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Object::String) object
class which is provided to the autobox STRING option.

## Undef Methods

Undef methods are called on undef values, for example, using `$undef->method(@args)`, which will act on the `$undef` value and will
return a new data type object. Many undef methods are simply wrappers around
core functions, but there are additional operations and modifications to core
behavior. Undef methods are handled via the [Data::Object::Undef](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Object::Undef) object
class which is provided to the autobox UNDEF option.

## Universal Methods

Universal methods can be called on any values, for example, using `$universal->method(@args)`, which will act on the reference or value and will
return a new data type object. Many universal methods are simply wrappers around
core functions, but there are additional operations and modifications to core
behavior. Universal methods are handled via the [Data::Object::Universal](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Object::Universal)
object class which is provided to the autobox UNIVERSAL option.
